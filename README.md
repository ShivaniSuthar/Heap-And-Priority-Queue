# Heap-And-Priority-Queue-In-Java
## Project Summary:
I programmed a classic heap data structure and priority queue in Java. The dHeapInterface file contains the interface I used to create my heap. 
The dHeap file contains the actual implementation of the heap including adding data to the heap, retrieving the number of elements in the heap, and removing the root element from the heap. The dHeapTester file tests these methods. The HeapSort file contains a sorting algorithm that uses the heap structure to sort an input integer array.The MyPriorityQueue file contains the implementation of a priority queue including methods such as inserting an element into the queue, retrieving an element from the queue, and clearing the queue. 
 
This project utilized interface construction, exception handling, and a conceptual knowledge of how heaps and queues work.
 
Testing was done using J-Unit testing.
