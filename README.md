# Heap-And-Priority-Queue-In-Java
## Project Summary:
I programmed the classic heap data structure and priority queue in Java. The _dHeapInterface file contains the interface I used to create my heap. 
The _dHeap file contains the actual implementation of the heap adding data to a heap, retrieving the number of elements in the heap, and removing the root element
from a heap. The _dHeapTester file tests these methods. The _HeapSort file contains a sorting algorithm that uses the heap structure to sort an input integer array.
The _MyPriorityQueue file contains the implementation of a priority queue including methods such as inserting an element into the queue, retrieving an element from
the queue, and clearing the queue. 
 
Knowledge of how heaps and queues work, interface construction, and exception handling were all methods used in this project.
 
Testing was done using J-Unit testing.
